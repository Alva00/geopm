ISSUES
======

issue-geopmpolicy-whitelist-root
    - "geopmpolicy -w" requires root access, but output is only a
      function of cpuid (2015-10-12).

issue-geopmpolicy-extra-obj
    - There are many objects compiled into libgeopmpolicy which are
      not needed (2015-10-30).

issue-out-of-place-testing
    - Building out of place works correctly, but testing out of place
      does not, gtest links are broken and the license header check
      does not work (2015-10-30).


BACKLOG
=======

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

extend-unit-tests
    - Test coverage is too low.  Need to expand unit testing to
      increase coverage. (2015-12-14)

create-examples
    - Generate an example for all important use cases of geopm with
      the focus on using these examples as our integration test
      suite. (2015-12-14)

automated-ci
    - Do some automated continuous integration testing, currently only
      doing developer workstation testing. (2015-12-14)

improve-documentation
    - Add detail to doxygen comments where @brief descriptions are all
      that is provided.  Unify documentation style. (2015-12-14)

post-backlog-to-github
    - Post this backlog to github issues. (2015-12-14)


MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------

converge-recording-interfaces
    - Need to solidify interfaces for recording, retrieving and
      interpolating collected data. (2015-12-14)

decider-interface-publish-subscribe
    - Design publish/subscriber interface to enable decider plug-in
      access to information used to make decisions. (2015-12-14)

collect-msr-telemetry
    - The Controller should use the Platform to sample MSRs and record
      the results. (2015-12-14)

record-meaningful-timestamps
    - It is safe to compare time stamps generated on the same compute
      node, use these for interpolating data within the node before
      sending external to the node. (2015-12-14)

define-power-model
    - If the PowerModel class is to play a role in the interface
      described in decider-interface-publish-subscribe, define what
      that is. Is this a plugin? (2015-12-14)

implement-power-model
    - After define-power-model, implement this design. (2015-12-14)

fix-platform-interfaces
    - Platform interface currently has an observe method, this needs
      to be redesigned.(2015-12-14)

decider-plugin-selection
    - Design implement and test an interface to select decider
      plug-ins. (2015-12-14)

interpolate-data
    - Data is sampled at different times.  In particular hardware
      counters sampled by the controller and application profile
      feedback sampled by each compute application MPI rank are
      asynchronous. (2015-12-14)

send-samples-up-tree
    - Construct a geopm_sample_message_s by combining a
      geopm_prof_message_s and Platform data and send result up
      tree. (2015-12-14)

send-policy-down-tree
    - Interface Controller and Decider in order to enact policy
      decisions. (2015-12-14)


EXTENDED FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------

generate-aggregated-report
    - Currently one report file per compute node, aggregate data based
      on depth parameter passed to the Profile::print()
      method. (2015-12-14)

gui-report-explorer
    - Need some post-processing application to enable exploration of
      generated report data. (2015-12-14)

barrier-option-region-end
    - Provide option where geopm_prof_exit() calls into a
      MPI_Barrier() over the ranks on the calling process's
      node. (2015-12-14)

enable-geopm-profiling
    - Enable performance profiling of the geopm code itself.
      Determine the overhead the run-time requires and enable
      reporting at different levels of granularity. (2015-12-14)

enable-automatic-profiling
    - Provide interface for algorithms attempting to do automatic
      detection of application profile data. (2015-12-14)

enable-trace-dumping
    - Provide a mechanism for dumping application trace data to disk
      for post processing analysis. (2015-12-14)

investigate-powerapi-integration
    - Look into how geopm might integrate with Sandia's
      PowerAPI. (2015-12-14)

collect-bmc-data
    - Collect out of band data at a low sample rate and interpolate
      results. (2015-12-14)
