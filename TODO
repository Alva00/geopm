BUGS
----

geopmpolicy-whitelist-root
    - "geopmpolicy -w" requires root access, but output is only a
      function of cpuid (2015-10-12).

geopmpolicy-extra-obj
    - There are many objects compiled into libgeopmpolicy which are
      not needed (2015-10-30).

out-of-place-testing
    - Building out of place works correctly, but testing out of place
      does not, gtest links are broken and the license header check
      does not work (2015-10-30).

redesign-platform-interfaces
    - Platform interface currently has an observe method, this needs
      to be redesigned.(2015-12-14)


ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------

extend-unit-tests
    - Test coverage is too low.  Need to expand unit testing to
      increase coverage. (2015-12-14)

create-examples
    - Generate an example for all important use cases of geopm with
      the focus on using these examples as our integration test
      suite. (2015-12-14)

improve-documentation
    - Add detail to doxygen comments where @brief descriptions are all
      that is provided.  Unify documentation style. (2015-12-14)


HIGH PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------

converge-recording-interfaces
    - Need to solidify interfaces for recording, retrieving and
      interpolating collected data. Time series data is being
      collected at different cadences and from different sources.  The
      decider requires coherent samples. (2015-12-14)

collect-msr-telemetry
    - The Platform should be used to sample RAPL and performance
      counter results through the MSR interface.  Need to solidify
      design of class interactions and responsibilities in the process
      of access, recording, interpolating and retrieving this
      data. (2015-12-14)

define-power-model
    - If the PowerModel class is to play a role in the
      converge-recording-interfaces task, define this role.  Is this a
      plugin? (2015-12-14)

implement-power-model
    - After define-power-model, implement this design. (2015-12-14)

decider-plugin-selection
    - Design implement and test a user and administrator interface to
      select decider plug-ins. (2015-12-14)

interpolate-data
    - Data is sampled at different times.  In particular hardware
      counters sampled by the controller and application profile
      feedback sampled by each compute application MPI rank are
      asynchronous.  Need infrastructure to support basic
      interpolation routines: nearest neighbor and linear to start.
      (2015-12-14)

send-samples-up-tree
    - Construct a geopm_sample_message_s by combining a
      geopm_prof_message_s and Platform data and send result up
      tree. (2015-12-14)

send-policy-down-tree
    - Interface Controller and Decider in order to enact policy
      decisions through the tree hierarchy. (2015-12-14)

barrier-option-region-end
    - Provide option where geopm_prof_exit() calls into a
      MPI_Barrier() over the ranks on the calling process's node. This
      can be useful for debugging. (2015-12-14)

enable-geopm-profiling
    - Enable performance profiling of the geopm code itself.
      Determine the overhead the run-time requires and enable
      reporting at different levels of granularity. (2015-12-14)

investigate-powerapi-integration
    - Look into how geopm might integrate with Sandia's
      PowerAPI. (2015-12-14)

collect-bmc-data
    - Collect out of band data at a low sample rate and interpolate
      results. Find a way to get access to this data on the compute
      cores, especially when CPU doesn't have access to out of band
      network supporting BMC data. (2015-12-14)


LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------------

automated-ci
    - Do some automated continuous integration testing, currently only
      doing developer workstation testing. (2015-12-14)

generate-aggregated-report
    - Currently one report file per compute node, aggregate data based
      on depth parameter passed to the Profile::print()
      method. (2015-12-14)

gui-report-explorer
    - Write a post-processing application to enable exploration of
      generated report data. This is a nice to have feature, and may
      be especially useful for debug purposes, but is a low priority.
      (2015-12-14)

decider-interface-publish-subscribe
    - Design publish/subscriber interface to enable decider plug-in
      access to information used to make decisions. This pattern may
      be too restrictive to enable required extension, but look into
      possibility. (2015-12-14)

enable-automatic-profiling
    - Provide interface for algorithms attempting to do automatic
      detection of application regions and progress through analysis
      of hardware events. This is a stretch goal: although the data
      required will be collected, designing the interface to provide
      it to an outside agent may break designs for
      encapsulation. (2015-12-14)

enable-trace-dumping
    - Provide a mechanism for dumping application trace data to disk
      for post processing analysis.  This trace would include
      telemetry data, application feedback data and decisions made by
      the geopm run-time. (2015-12-14)
