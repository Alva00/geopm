ISSUES
======

issue-geopmpolicy-whitelist-root
    - "geopmpolicy -w" requires root access, but output is only a function of
      cpuid (2015-10-12).

issue-geopmpolicy-extra-obj
    - There are many objects compiled into libgeopmpolicy which are not
      needed (2015-10-30).

issue-out-of-place-testing
    - Building out of place works correctly, but testing out of place does
      not, gtest links are broken and the license header check does not work
      (2015-10-30).

issue-app-shutdown-signal-shmem
    - Need a way for the application to signal to the geopm runtime that it is
      shutting down (2015-11-04).

Notes on Phases
===============

Application Constraints
-----------------------
Application must call into geopm APIs from per-rank serial code.

Resolution of control is limited to sets of CPUs assigned to each MPI
rank.

If a library linked by the application uses geopm mark up for phases,
it must have some mechanism for generating a unique phase ID set
(offset based?).

Make mark up phase_end() API calls into a MPI_Barrier over the ranks
on the calling process' node?

All ranks must call mark up in same exact sequence.

All threads associated with an MPI rank must run within the same
resolution of control (e.g. socket/tile).
