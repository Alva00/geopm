BUGS
----

geopmpolicy-whitelist-root
    - "geopmpolicy -w" requires root access, but output is only a
      function of cpuid (2015-10-12).

geopmpolicy-extra-obj
    - There are many objects compiled into libgeopmpolicy which are
      not needed (2015-10-30).

out-of-place-testing
    - Building out of place works correctly, but testing out of place
      does not, gtest links are broken and the license header check
      does not work (2015-10-30).

redesign-platform-interfaces
    - Platform interface currently has an observe method, this needs
      to be redesigned.(2015-12-14)


ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------

extend-unit-tests
    - Test coverage is too low.  Need to expand unit testing to
      increase coverage. (2015-12-14)

create-examples
    - Generate an example for all important use cases of geopm with
      the focus on using these examples as our integration test
      suite. (2015-12-14)

improve-documentation
    - Add detail to doxygen comments where @brief descriptions are all
      that is provided.  Unify documentation style. (2015-12-14)


HIGH PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------

decider-plugin-selection
    - Design implement and test a user and administrator interface to
      select decider plug-ins. (2015-12-14)

barrier-option-region-end
    - Provide option where geopm_prof_exit() calls into a
      MPI_Barrier() over the ranks on the calling process's node. This
      can be useful for debugging. (2015-12-14)

enable-geopm-profiling
    - Enable performance profiling of the geopm code itself.
      Determine the overhead the run-time requires and enable
      reporting at different levels of granularity. (2015-12-14)

investigate-powerapi-integration
    - Look into how geopm might integrate with Sandia's
      PowerAPI. (2015-12-14)

collect-bmc-data
    - Collect out of band data at a low sample rate and interpolate
      results. Find a way to get access to this data on the compute
      cores, especially when CPU doesn't have access to out of band
      network supporting BMC data. (2015-12-14)


LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------------

automated-ci
    - Do some automated continuous integration testing, currently only
      doing developer workstation testing. (2015-12-14)

generate-aggregated-report
    - Currently one report file per compute node, aggregate data based
      on depth parameter passed to the Profile::print()
      method. (2015-12-14)

gui-report-explorer
    - Write a post-processing application to enable exploration of
      generated report data. This is a nice to have feature, and may
      be especially useful for debug purposes, but is a low priority.
      (2015-12-14)

decider-interface-publish-subscribe
    - Design publish/subscriber interface to enable decider plug-in
      access to information used to make decisions. This pattern may
      be too restrictive to enable required extension, but look into
      possibility. (2015-12-14)

enable-automatic-profiling
    - Provide interface for algorithms attempting to do automatic
      detection of application regions and progress through analysis
      of hardware events. This is a stretch goal: although the data
      required will be collected, designing the interface to provide
      it to an outside agent may break designs for
      encapsulation. (2015-12-14)

enable-trace-dumping
    - Provide a mechanism for dumping application trace data to disk
      for post processing analysis.  This trace would include
      telemetry data, application feedback data and decisions made by
      the geopm run-time. (2015-12-14)
