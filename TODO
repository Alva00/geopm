Notes on Phases
===============

Application Constraints
-----------------------
Application must call into geopm API's from per-rank serial code.

Resolution of control is limited to sets of CPU's assigned to each MPI
rank.

If a library linked by the applicaiton uses geopm mark up for phases,
it must have some mechanism for generating a unique phase ID set
(offset based?).

Make mark up phase_end() API calls into a MPI_Barrier over the ranks
on the calling process' node?

All ranks must call mark up in same exact sequence.

All threads associated with an MPI rank must run within the same
resolution of control (e.g. socket/tile).
