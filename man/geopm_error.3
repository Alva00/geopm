.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Almost all geopm C API's return an error number, and this is GEOPM's method of
exception handling.  This man page describes how to interpret these numbers.
A returned error number of zero by a GEOPM API indicates successs.  If the
error number returned by a GEOPM API is positive then this indicates a system
error, and if the error number is negative this indicates a GEOPM specific
error has occured.  Any non-zero error number can be converted into a
descriptive string with the
.BR geopm_error_message ()
function.  The GEOPM specific error numbers are enumerated in the
.I geopm_error.h
header file and they are described below.  The system error numbers are
documented in the
.BR errno (3)
man page.
